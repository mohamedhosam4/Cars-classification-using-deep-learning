# Car Classification Using Deep Learning

This project aims to classify car images into specific categories using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a balanced dataset of car images from the Stanford Cars Dataset and uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several main stages:

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess car images, ensuring they are organized by class for effective training.
2. **Model Architecture**: Build a deep CNN model to classify car images.
3. **Training**: Train the model on the dataset, with techniques like data augmentation and regularization to improve generalization.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance on test data.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict classes for new, unseen images.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (optional for additional metrics)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open `car_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to execute each cell step-by-step. Ensure the dataset is correctly loaded and organized before training.

3. **Train the Model**:
   Follow the steps in the notebook to train the model on the dataset.

4. **Make Predictions**:
   Once the model is trained, use it to predict car categories on new images.

## Project Structure

- `car_classification.ipynb`: Main notebook with code for data loading, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `images/`: Directory to store example images (optional).
- `checkpoints/`: Directory for saving model checkpoints.

## Example Results

After training, the model should achieve a satisfactory accuracy on the test dataset. Below is an example output:

| Metric       | Value         |
|--------------|---------------|
| Test Accuracy| 90%           |
| Loss         | 0.3           |

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with deeper networks or pretrained models for potentially better performance.
- Explore additional data augmentation techniques.
- Use transfer learning from models like ResNet or EfficientNet for enhanced accuracy.
